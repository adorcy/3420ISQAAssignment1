This repository contains the DFD, DFD Dictionary, and Use Cases for a company's open source software, (OSS) management. The process it 
describes provides developers a means to add or request OSS information. It also allows managers to request software documentation and 
policies as well as the ability to modify or add OSS policies. This is an important system for a business to have as managing the 
licesenses and vulnerabilities of OSS can be a daunting task with serious repurcussions if handled improperly. It also provides managers 
and developers with information that is vital to planning the design of new tools and technologies. 

This system allows managers and developers to retrieve company OSS policy douments from the OSS Source policy documents database to use in determining project operations. Managers also have the ability to modify or submit new policy documents that are then stored int the OSS Source policy documents database. It also allows developers to submit new pieces of OSS software that are then scanned for licenses and known vulnerabilities, the vulnerabilities are stored int the NIST Vulnerabilities database. The results of this scan are stored in the OSS Component Database. Managers and Developers can then query this database to compare the results against the company OSS policy documents in the OSS Source policy documents database. By comparing them the Managers and Developers can decide if or how to use a certain piece of OSS software.
